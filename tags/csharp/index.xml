      <description>Working with operators is an important part of learning how to program. Every programming language uses operators. You will need to use them in essentially every program you write. Therefore every programmer will have to learn how to use them.
In this post I will write about operators in C# and show examples of how to work with some of them.
What is an operator? An operator is a special character that allows you to process and perform different mathematical or logical operations on data types and objects.</description>

      <description>One of the first things most new programmers learn how to do is work with variables. In this post I will discuss the different types of variables in C# and describe what they are, why they are used, and how to use them.
If you are already setup with Visual Studio or MonoDevelop on your computer, you can follow along with the post and run or modify the code snippets on your own.</description>

      <description>This post will show you how to get started using the C# programming language without installing Visual Studio or any other IDE. C# is a great programming language to learn for anyone new to programming.
Regardless of the language, most fundamentals behind programming can be practiced and learned using only a text editor and the command line. Using the command line to compile and run code provides a faster way for new programmers to get going.</description>
