      <description>My goal with this website was to document and share everything that I learn related to programming and technology. If you look around, it&amp;rsquo;s obvious that I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much of that since I started this site in May of 2017. I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted or done a thing since January of last year. So in an effort to get things back swinging here, I decided to make a quick post about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to in my technical life for the last year and 4 months.</description>
