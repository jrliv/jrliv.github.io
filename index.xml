      <title>Logical Operators in C#</title>

      <description>Logical operators (also known as Boolean or conditional operators) usually compare two or more conditions and return a Boolean result (true or false). They must be used on boolean type operands or variables. They are widely used in C# programming and very useful when comparing more than one condition.
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t generally familiar with operators and precedence in programming then I recommend that you check out one of my previous blog posts on Working with Operators in C#.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Operators in C#</title>

      <description>Arithmetic operators are the most common operators used in programming. They perform mathematical operations on numerical values and return a numerical result. They are the same signs and operations that are used in math and everyday life.
If you aren&amp;rsquo;t generally familiar with operators and precedence in programming, then I suggest that you check out my previous blog post on Working with Operators in C#.
Here are the arithmetic operators used in C#:</description>

      <description>Working with operators is an important part of learning how to program. Every programming language uses operators. You will need to use them in essentially every program you write. Therefore every programmer will have to learn how to use them.
In this post I will write about operators in C# and show examples of how to work with some of them.
What is an operator? An operator is a special character that allows you to process and perform different mathematical or logical operations on data types and objects.</description>

      <description>These are a few .NET projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve done. Some were done as side projects for fun and learning while others I&amp;rsquo;ve done for class assignments. If you want to see all of my projects and work check out my GitHub repositories.

      <title>What Programming Language Should I Learn First?</title>
      <link>https://jrliv.com/post/what-programming-language-should-i-learn-first/</link>

      <description>I just wanted to write a quick post about my opinion of which programming language new developers should learn first. This question is so common. If you are a new developer, you might be trying to figure this question out right now. For some, this question can turn into a hurdle that they&amp;rsquo;re never able to jump over. It can be a critical question.
Trust me when I say you aren&amp;rsquo;t alone.</description>

      <title>My First Pull Request</title>

      <description>In this post I want to share my experience submitting my first pull request and contributing to open source. Honestly, my contribution wasn’t planned at all. It just kind of happened. I knew about open source software and how the idea worked but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to actually use git and attempt to submit a pull request to fix an issue on GitHub. The actual process itself turned out to be easier than I thought.</description>

      <title>Working with Variables in C#</title>

      <description>One of the first things most new programmers learn how to do is work with variables. In this post I will discuss the different types of variables in C# and describe what they are, why they are used, and how to use them.
If you are already setup with Visual Studio or MonoDevelop on your computer, you can follow along with the post and run or modify the code snippets on your own.</description>

      <title>Get Started Using C# Without Visual Studio</title>

      <description>This post will show you how to get started using the C# programming language without installing Visual Studio or any other IDE. C# is a great programming language to learn for anyone new to programming.
Regardless of the language, most fundamentals behind programming can be practiced and learned using only a text editor and the command line. Using the command line to compile and run code provides a faster way for new programmers to get going.</description>

      <description>I’m a computer science student and a programmer. Most of my programming and development experience is with C# and the .NET Framework. C# is my favorite programming language right now.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also played with all kinds of other languages such as C, C++, Java, VB.NET, Python, JavaScript, PHP, Scheme, Clojure, and COBOL. Out of those languages I&amp;rsquo;m most familiar with C, Java, and VB.NET.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on the front end as well with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.</description>
