      <description>Working with operators is an important part of learning how to program. Every programming language uses operators and you will need to use them in essentially every program you write. Therefore every programmer will have to learn how to use them. In this post I will write about the different types of operators in C# and describe what they are and what they do.
What is an operator? An operator is a special character that allows you to process and perform different mathematical or logical operations on data types and objects.</description>

 Donation App A WPF desktop application created with C# that allows you to enter a donation amount and your name. When you click the Donate button, the donation amount after expenses and the total amount of donations raised are calculated and displayed.
 Hourly Wage Calculator A WPF desktop application that I created using C#. The application allows you to enter an employee&amp;rsquo;s information, display the information, as well as calculate and display their hourly pay based on the number of hours they worked.</description>

      <description>I just wanted to write a quick post about my opinion of which programming language new developers should learn first. This question is so common. If you are a new developer, you might be trying to figure this question out right now. For some, this question can turn into a hurdle that they&amp;rsquo;re never able to jump over. It can be a critical question.
Trust me when I say you aren&amp;rsquo;t alone.</description>

      <description>In this post I want to share my experience submitting my first pull request and contributing to open source. Honestly, my contribution wasn’t planned at all. It just kind of happened. I knew about open source software and how the idea worked but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to actually use git and attempt to submit a pull request to fix an issue on GitHub. The actual process itself turned out to be easier than I thought.</description>

      <description>One of the first things most new programmers learn how to do is work with variables. In this post I will discuss the different types of variables in C# and describe what they are, why they are used, and how to use them.
If you are already setup with Visual Studio or MonoDevelop on your computer, you can follow along with the post and run or modify the code snippets on your own.</description>

      <title>Get Started Using C# Without Visual Studio</title>

      <description>This post will show you how to get started using the C# programming language without installing Visual Studio or any other IDE. C# is a great programming language to learn for anyone new to programming.
Regardless of the language, most fundamentals behind programming can be practiced and learned using only a text editor and the command line. Using the command line to compile and run code provides a faster way for new programmers to get going.</description>

      <description>I’m a Computer Science student and a software developer focusing on C# and the .NET Framework. Most of my programming experience is with C#. It&amp;rsquo;s my favorite programming language right now. I have some past experience with Java, VB.NET, and COBOL. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on the front end as well with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I also have experience working in I.T. support resolving technical and hardware related issues.
This site is where I blog everything that I learn related to technology and computer science so I can document things for myself and share with others.</description>
